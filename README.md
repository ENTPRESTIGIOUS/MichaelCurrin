## Hi, I am a software maker
> Also a "Data genie" and "open sourcerer"

I'm a Senior Software Engineer in South Africa, working in online education. I build a lot of projects for fun with Python, JavaScript, Jekyll and more. A big fan of elegant designs, clean code, and static site generators.

My homepage is [bio.link/michaelcurrin](https://bio.link/michaelcurrin).

    - frontend (webpage design and JS)
- security
- DevOps
    - containers
    - infrastructure management 
    - deployment pipelines
- automated tests (including TDD, BDD, and monitoring and observability)
- architecture 
- data science
    - web scraping
    - data visualization 
    - Machine Learning 

And more specifically, the tools I use.

### GitHub Stats

I've been writing code daily for a few years, so have a growing ridiculous number of repos (over 200, mostly not forks) and number commits. Here are some stats from the GitHub Readme Stats project for my profile.

<a href="https://github.com/MichaelCurrin">

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=MichaelCurrin&title_color=ffffff&text_color=c9cacc&icon_color=2bbc8a&bg_color=1d1f21"

The `S` score means "Top 1%" and is better than `A+`. Stats generated using [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).


### Projects ðŸ’¼

If you're interested to see my showcase of some my best projects, see my Pinned Repositories a bit further down on my profile.

I like to make quickstarts which can be used as templates to make websites, such as with React, Vue, MkDocs, Jekyll or Docsify. See my [quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories&q=quickstart&type=&language=) projects on GitHub.

My gists are available on a one-page site: https://michaelcurrin.github.io/gist-viewer/

### I'm currently working on ðŸ”­ 

Here are projects or ideas which I have been working on in the last few months.

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>

- Always writing and improving on [Dev Cheatsheets](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/dev-cheatsheets/) and [Code Cookbook](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook)
- Writing more and better blog posts
- Improving my [Badge generator](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator) project.
- Icons
     - How can I use this in my website projects? As external source but also I can download the icons I care about as a central reference https://simpleicons.org/ Add it to my cheatsheats - including color for eahc
     - Compare with GH Topic icons which are more detailed. [repo](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics)
     - Maybe make a generator which can generate both.
- Better Jekyll sites and designing websites
- Make a [Self-updating README](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/) - based on [github.com/simonw/simonw](https://github.com/simonw/simonw)
- How can I use GitHub projects to manage my projects at a high-level or just bookmark repos and gists there? Rather than maintaining a list.

### What is this README profile thing? ðŸ¤”

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
     
This page you are reading is a profile readme. Around July 2020, GitHub made this a public feature.

To make one, create a repo named after your username (matching case exactly) and create a `README.md` file in it. Then go to your GitHub profile and you'll see your README appear there âœ¨.

- GitHub topic: [profile-readme](https://github.com/topics/profile-readme)
- Tutorial: [How To Create A GitHub Profile README](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme)
