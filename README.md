## Hi, I am a software maker
> I am a "Data genie", maker, "open sourcerer" and code junkie

I am a fullstack software engineer. I love to build websites, automate, scrape websites, visualize data. I like to teach and learn others both at community events and online.

### Skills ðŸŽ“

My experiences covers backend (databases, APIs), frontend (webpage design and JS) and security, containers and deployment pipelines.

### Projects ðŸ’¼

If you're interested to see my showcase of some my best projects, see my Pinned Repositories a bit further down on my profile.

I like to make quickstarts which can be used as templates to make websites, such as with React, Vue, MkdDocs, Jekyll or Docsify. See my GitHub [quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories&q=quickstart&type=&language=) projects.

### I'm currently working on ðŸ”­ 

Here are projects or ideas which I have been working on in the last few months.

- Revising my [Dev Cheatsheets](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/dev-cheatsheets/) and [Code Cookbook](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook)
- Writing more and better blog posts
- Improving my [Badge generator](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator) project without overengineering - React or Jekyll might be overkill and need a lot of refactoring before it is useful but Moustache templating and a bit of duplication of code working well.
- Icons
     - How can I use this in my website projects? As external source but also I can download the icons I care about as a central reference https://simpleicons.org/ Add it to my cheatsheats - including color for eahc
     - Compare with GH Topic icons which are more detailed. [repo](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics)
     - Maybe make a generator which can generate both.
- Better Jekyll sites and designing websites
- Make a [Self-updating README](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/) - based on [github.com/simonw/simonw](https://github.com/simonw/simonw)
- How can I use GitHub projects to manage my projects at a high-level or just bookmark repos and gists there? Rather than maintaing a list.

### What is this README profile thing? ðŸ¤”

This section is about this very page you are looking at.

Around July 2020, GitHub made this a public feature. Create a repo named after your username (matching case exactly) and create a `README.md` file in it. Then go to your GitHub profile and you'll see your README appear there âœ¨.

- [MichaelCurrin/MichaelCurrin](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/MichaelCurrin/) repo where this README lives
- GitHub topic: [profile-readme](https://github.com/topics/profile-readme)
- Tutorial: [How To Create A GitHub Profile README](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme)

<!--
**MichaelCurrin/MichaelCurrin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
